# Roboto

A directory containing all files and programs used in the Roboto Project.

Roboto(he's spanish) is meant to be an open-ended computer vision project made possible with a Thymio-2 robot, Raspberry Pi, and of course--cameras.

Current installments include a line/color following algorithm, and a neural network to approximate the corresponding regression analysis
