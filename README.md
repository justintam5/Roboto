# Roboto

A repository containing all files and programs used in the Roboto Project--an open-ended, 2-wheel robot.

Roboto(he's spanish) is meant to be a modular computer vision project made possible with a Thymio-2 robot, Raspberry Pi, and of course, cameras.

Current installments include a line/color following algorithm, and a CNN to approximate the corresponding regression analysis. The neural network has not been tested itself in real time on the robot, but did obtain accuracy up to about +-10 pixels. The network involved was regressional, simply to see how it could compare against the much more used 'discrete ouput' CNNs.

Cheers,
